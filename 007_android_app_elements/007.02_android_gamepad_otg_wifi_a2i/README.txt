The a038_973_gamepad_otg_wifi.aia is the MIT Application2Innovator, A2I, project artifact.  It must 
be imported into the A2I IDE.  The g038_otg_serial.aix and UrsAI2UDPv3.aix must both be imported 
into the A2I project environment for provide the components and functionality for OTG-Serial
and WIFI-UDP communication.

A "Build" of the project will yield the a038_973_gamepad_otg_wifi.apk which can then
be uploaded to a targetted Android.
