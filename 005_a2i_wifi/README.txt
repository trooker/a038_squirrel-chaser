This directory contains a spike that was used to generate an early proof 
of concept regarding WIFI communication via UDP.

The a038_rc_wifi_991.aia and its associated extension UrsAI2UDPv3.aix
were incorporated in the a038_gamepad_otg_wifi.aia.  The a038_rc_wifi_991
provides the required WIFI functions and properties.  

This folder provides the aia and aix for the WIFI as design maturity artifacts
that may be useful in future projects.

The *.apk is also provided should there be a need to test on a Android 
device.   

They are present "as-is" with no plans to support future changes.
